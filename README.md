## üåü Overview

The **Smart Patient Health Assistant** is a comprehensive AI-powered healthcare system designed to address critical gaps in healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The system combines advanced machine learning algorithms with practical healthcare guidance to provide:

- **Multi-disease risk prediction** (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Kidney Disease)
- **Intelligent risk stratification** (Green/Yellow/Red zones)
- **Personalized health recommendations**
- **Location-based hospital finder**
- **Emergency response integration**

### üéØ Key Objectives

1. **Advanced Health Risk Prediction** - Achieve ‚â•85% accuracy across all disease categories
2. **Intelligent Recommendations** - Evidence-based suggestions following WHO/CDC guidelines
3. **Risk Stratification** - Three-tier classification with clear action protocols
4. **Location Services** - Integration with Google Maps API for nearest hospitals
5. **Emergency Response** - SOS functionality with automatic contact notification
